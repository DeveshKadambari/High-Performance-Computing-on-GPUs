# High-Performance-Computing-on-GPUs
In this repository I have coded in CUDA C for GPU`s. In order to run these codes you would require an NVIDIA GPU. I have run the code on Titan xp GPUs using SSH terminals on Linux platform which can be further used even with other computers.
For more information on executing the codes or sematic meaning of the codes. Please feel free to contact me on 4054029613

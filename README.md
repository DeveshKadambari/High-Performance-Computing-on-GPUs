# High-Performance-Computing-on-GPUs
In this repository I have coded in CUDA C for GPU`s. In order to run these codes you would require an NVIDIA GPU. I have run the code on Titan xp GPUs using SSH terminals on Linux platform which can be further used even with other computers.
Assignment 1=> Matrix multiplication on GPUs

Assignment 2=> Parallel reduction of the hugh datasets

Assigment 3 => atomic operations on GPU

Project => Creation of a 3 layer CNN from scratch in both C++ and CUDA


For more information on executing the codes or sematic meaning of the codes. Please feel free to contact me on deveshkadambari@gmail.com
